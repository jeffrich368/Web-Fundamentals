    <h2>Jeffrey Adongo</h2>
    <p>My name is Jeffrey Adongo. I am currently pursuing my degree in Software Developement at the BYU Idaho University.
       I love to paint and design whenever I have some leisure time. 
    </p>
    <p>I currently work as a frreelance Graphic Designer. I have come to know that if I take this classes seriously,
        I  will be able to develop visually appealing websites.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of latter day Saints
        for the past 15 years. I love how the Church is structured and organised.
